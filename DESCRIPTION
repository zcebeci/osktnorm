Description: Implements the Optimized Skewness and Kurtosis Transformation
    (OSKT), a moment-targeting normality transformation designed to
    simultaneously reduce asymmetry and excess peakedness in non-normal
    data. The method is based on the Tukey g-and-h distribution, with
    skewness and kurtosis parameters optimized by minimizing an objective
    function derived from the Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit statistic
    with Stephen's correction factor. Parameter estimation is performed 
    using the L-BFGS-B algorithm to improve the fit to the standard normal
    distribution. The OSKT approach aims to balance symmetry and tail 
    behavior and can be used as an alternative to power-based transformations
    such as Box-Cox and Yeo-Johnson, as well as moment-matching methods based 
    on the Lambert W x F.
